  <p>We here encourage people to inform about Child Labour and we will do our best to 
    stop them. We are connected with NGOs that helps children and raise voice for their 
    rights. Children are future of any country But Millions of children around the world
    are trapped in child labour, depriving them of their childhood, their health and 
    education, putting them in the depth of poverty.</p>

 <p>Of course, there is work that children do to help their 
    families in ways that are neither harmful nor exploitative.
    But many children are stuck in unacceptable work for children â€“ a serious 
    violation of their rights. Help us to fight against such practices.
    We aim at stopping child exploitation for a better nation</p>
